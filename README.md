Duku Linux
==========
Duku is a Linux distribution based on Sabayon. Made for power users and developers who want a highly customizable and efficient Linux distribution.

Description
===========
Duku does things differently while still being usable out-of-the-box. As ppreviously mentioned, Duku is geared towards Unix wizards, Jedi Knights, programmers, and power users alike. Because of this, we stray from the norm a bit.
By default, things are a little bit different than what most people may be used to in terms of defaults. The default environment is the awesome window manager. GTK and Qt aren't even installed by default! It is a window manager that has 9 different workspaces (or "tags") that can be manipulated by the keyboard to organize windows. It also has customizable "widgets", small meters or text displays that tell you information about your system's current state.
Awesome is highly customizable and efficient, and helps a lot with productivity for programmers, and for space management for power users. It also has a tiling feature, where you can choose from several different "layouts" which windows will be "tiled" or laid out in.
Another way Duku differs from the norm is that it uses ZSH instead of BASH by default. ZSH is almost identical to BASH, but it has a few different core features, two of the most apparent being a different tab completion system and more customizability in your .zshrc. For instance, you can make parts of your PS1 appear on the right side of the terminal instead of on the left. You can also install plugins, such as syntax highlighting (which will highlight commands green if they work and red if not).
Tmux, or terminal multiplexer, is also installed by default. Tmux lets you do lots of things, but among them are splitting terminal windows, having multiple "tabs" in one terminal (like having multiple terminal windows open, but all accessable from one terminal), and detaching and reattaching (similar to screen).

Even WITH all of these great, helpful features, Duku still maintains minimalism. We believe in a bloat-less system; including only what will be useful and nothing more.

Unique Features
===============
NTK - The Noran Toolkit provides utilities for IRC bot developers, programming language designers, and mathematic application developers. NTK is also very minimal, coming in at about 400 KB.

Bobcat - Bobcat is an extensive post-installation script made by us here at Duku Linux, Kodiak and dymatic.

Durian - Durian is an easy GUI application made by yours truly (Kodiak) to be run on first boot that allows the user to customize his ZSH install in many ways, including syntax highlighting and extensive PS1 modifications and options.
