===What is bobcat?
Bobcat is an application used for startup scripts or general scripting in general. It does not require any particular shell and is cross-compatible.
At the heart of the project is a configurable core that even a non-programmer could understand.

===The def file
The definition file has an ugly yet simple syntax.

PROMPT_arg#command%arg2#command2

Map: 
Prompt is what the user sees
arg is when to execute a certain command. "if(arg is found) execute this:
command is what to execute at a shell.
% acts as if the REPL is right after _

Syntax key:
_:Seperate prompt and the rest
#:Separate arg from prompt
%:Separate arg-prompt pairs

===Command-line args
-h or --help: Display help
-v or --version: Display version
arg: arg is the path to the def file.
